### Hi there 👋

Inspired by seeing the constantly moving crane yard in Busan New Port, I participated in the 2021_GECCO_Competition as a graduation project. I got a result with a ranking record in 3,6,9 stacks.
I got the result by creating a meta-rule and implementing the additional rules below.

부산신항에서 끊임없이 움직이는 크레인 장치장을보며 영감받아 졸업과제로 2021_GECCO_Competition에 참가 했습니다. 3,6,9 stack에서 랭킹기록을 보유한 결과를 얻었습니다.
메타규칙을 만들고, 아래 추가 규칙을 추가로 구현하여 결과를 얻었습니다.
